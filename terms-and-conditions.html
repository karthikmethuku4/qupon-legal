      <h1>Qupon – Terms & Conditions</h1>

      <div class="meta">
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> Tuesday, 21 October 2025<br />
        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> Tuesday, 21 October 2025

      <h2>1. About Qupon</h2>
      <p>
        Qupon is a digital platform that allows users to upload, buy, and sell
        valid discount coupons. Our mission is to make unused coupons valuable
        and accessible to everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 13 years or older to use Qupon. Users under 18 require
        parental or guardian supervision. You must provide accurate information
        during registration, including phone number, email, and payment details
        (if applicable). Linking a bank account or UPI is optional but required
        to receive earnings from coupon sales.
      </p>

      <h2>3. User Account & Verification</h2>
      <p>
        You can sign up using your email or phone number with OTP verification.
        OTPs are sent via a trusted third-party provider that complies with
        security standards. By using Qupon, you consent to receive OTP messages
        for login and verification. We do not store OTPs or share them beyond
        the verification process. You are responsible for keeping your login
        details confidential.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Coupon Uploading</h2>
      <p>
        Users uploading coupons must provide brand name, coupon code, heading,
        expiry date, and a screenshot or terms & conditions. The Qupon Admin
        team verifies each coupon before listing. Invalid, expired, or
        single-use coupons tied to specific accounts or IPs are not accepted.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Buying & Selling Coupons</h2>
      <p>
        Coupons are displayed under Browse Deals with brand logos, headings, and
        hidden codes. After a successful purchase, the coupon code becomes
        visible in the Purchased Coupons section. If a coupon fails verification
        during purchase, a full refund is issued. Qupon facilitates the
        transaction but is not responsible for brand-specific redemption issues.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Profile Levels</h2>
      <p>
        Level 1 (Spark): Default level, 7 coupons/day limit. Level 2 (Blaze):
        Unlocks after selling/buying 34 verified coupons, 10 coupons/day, 1%
        buyer discount. Level 3 (Inferno): Unlocks after 37 more verified
        coupons, 13 coupons/day, 1.5–2% buyer discount.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Earnings & Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Sellers receive payment after a coupon is sold. All transactions use
        secure payment gateways and are logged for compliance. Linked bank or
        UPI details are encrypted and used only for withdrawals. Qupon never
        stores or shares financial credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Privacy & Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is collected and processed in line with our Privacy Policy. We
        only collect essential details (phone number, email, coupon data, and
        optional bank info). We use encryption and secure servers to protect
        your information. We do not sell or share personal data with advertisers
        or third parties. You may request data deletion at any time by
        contacting businessqupon@gmail.com — all data will be deleted within 7
        business days, except as required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Analytics & Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Qupon may use Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics to analyze app
        usage trends. This data is aggregated and non-personal. We do not use
        cookies or track individual users.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Prohibited Activities</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to upload fake, expired, or tampered coupons, misuse the
        platform for fraud or spam, or attempt to hack, modify, or disrupt
        Qupon's systems. Violations may result in account suspension or
        permanent ban.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Third-Party Service Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        We use third-party OTP, verification, and payment providers. While we
        ensure compliance with data protection standards, Qupon is not liable
        for unauthorized access or failures caused by these providers or
        external networks.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All app designs, logos, and content belong to Qupon. You may not copy,
        distribute, or modify them without written permission.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Liability Limitation</h2>
      <p>
        Qupon is not responsible for issues on third-party brand sites or
        payment gateways, OTP delivery delays or failures by external providers,
        or losses due to incorrect uploads or user mistakes. Use of Qupon is at
        your own discretion and risk.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Account Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Users may delete their account anytime via the app or by emailing us.
        Qupon reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate
        our policies.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms periodically. Users will be notified through
        email or in-app alerts about significant updates. Continued use after
        changes implies acceptance of new terms.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of India, under the jurisdiction of
        Hyderabad, Telangana. Disputes will be resolved through arbitration or
        competent civil courts.
